TODO

TO ADD:
    - Animation switch based on movement
    - Sounds
    - Music
    - Lighting!
        - Background layer that's rendered to a texture with a different camera?
            - Need to find a way to attribute different layers to different cameras, so we can render the Normal and Height seperatly for the shader.
        - Then both textures are pipped to the shader and rendered onto a Mesh2d by the "outside" camera

TO FIX:
    - Switch player anim to hidding when hidding
